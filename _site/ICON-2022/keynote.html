                                                <br>
                                                <strong>Abstract: </strong> Natural language processing (NLP) has made truly impressive progress in recent
                                                years, and is being deployed in an ever-increasing range of user-facing
                                                settings. Accompanied by this progress has been a growing realisation of
                                                inequities in the performance of naively-trained NLP models for users of
                                                different demographics, with minority groups typically experiencing lower
                                                performance levels. In this talk, I will discuss the complexities of the
                                                evaluation of model "fairness", and how standard evaluation practice has led
                                                to unfair/misleading claims in the literature.

                                                <strong>Keynote Title: </strong> Personalised Longitudinal Natural Language Processing
                                                <br>
                                                <strong>Abstract: </strong> In most of the tasks and models that we have made great progress with in recent years, such as text classification and natural language inference, there isn't a notion of time. However many of these tasks are sensitive to changes and temporality in real world data, especially when pertaining to individuals, their behaviour and their evolution over time. I will present our programme of work on personalised longitudinal natural language processing. This consists in developing natural language processing methods to: (1) represent individuals over time from their language and other heterogenous and multi-modal content (2) capture changes in individuals' behaviour over time (3) generate and evaluate synthetic data from individuals' content over time (4) summarise the progress of an individual over time, incorporating information about changes. I will discuss progress and challenges this far as well as the implications of this programme of work for downstream tasks such as mental health monitoring.

She holds a UKRI/EPSRC Turing AI fellowship (2020-2025) on Creating time sensitive sensors from user-generated language and heterogeneous content. The research in this fellowship involves developing new methods for NLP and multi-modal data to allow the creation of longitudinal personalized language monitoring. She is also the PI of projects on language sensing for dementia monitoring & diagnosis, opinion summarisation and rumour verification from social media. At the Alan Turing Institute she founded and co-leads the NLP and data science for mental health special interest groups. She has published over 150 papers on topics including sentiment analysis, semantics, summarisation, rumour verification, resources and evaluation and biomedical NLP. She is action editor for the ACL rolling review and regularly holds senior roles in conference and workshop organisation.
