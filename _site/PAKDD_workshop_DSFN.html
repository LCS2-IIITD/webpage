            <h2><i>Workshop on Data Science for Fake News</i></h2>
<p><br /></p>

<h4><b>Scope:</b></h4>
<p>The contributed program in this workshop will be primarily formed by a number
of research papers presenting new research on data science for fake news. These
would cover data science research for fake news, that could be traditionally be
under the following heads in terms of methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Graph Analytics</li>
  <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
  <li>Deep Learning</li>
  <li>Computer Vision</li>
  <li>Image Processing</li>
  <li>Affective Computing</li>
  <li>Game Theory</li>
  <li>Information Retrieval</li>
  <li>Social Media Analytics</li>
  <li>Spatio-temporal Data Mining</li>
  <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
  <li>Semi-supervised Learning</li>
  <li>Supervised Learning</li>
  <li>Crowdsourcing and Active Learning
<br /><br />
We will particularly encourage papers that cover multiple such methodological building blocks in building a technology to combat fake news.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Keynote</b></h4>
<p><b>Title:</b> Some Lessons Learned in Detecting and Explaining Fake News on Social Media</p>

<p>Huan Liu and Kai Shu<br />
Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p>In recent years, fake news has become a global phenomenon, particularly so during the pandemic, COVID-19. The wide dissemination of fake news can have detrimental societal effects on individuals and the society. Despite the recent progress in detecting fake news, it remains a challenging task due to its complexity, diversity, multi-modality, speed, and costs of fact-checking or annotation. In this talk, we look at some lessons learned when exploring effective and explainable detecting strategies of fake news, and discuss challenges in fake news research and the need for interdisciplinary research.</p>
