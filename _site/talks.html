                  <p> In order to bring the performance of people analytics in the algorithmically infused workplace up — and in line with the hype — organizations need to do more than analyze data on demographic attributes. We need to focus not only on who people are but also who they know. The potential for social network analysis to identify “high potentials,” who has good ideas, who is influential, what teams will get work done efficiently and effectively is well established based on decades of research. The challenge has been the collection of network data via surveys that are time consuming, elicit low response rates and have a high obsolescence. This talk presents empirical examples ranging from corporate enterprises to simulated long duration space exploration to demonstrate how we can leverage people analytics – and in particular relational analytics - to mine “digital exhaust”— data created by individuals every day in their digital transactions, such as e‐mails, chats, “likes,” “follows,” @mentions, and file collaboration— to address challenges they face with issues such as team conflict, team assembly, diversity and inclusion, succession planning, and post-merger integration. </p>

                  <p>ML on graphs is a prominent, and rapidly developing research area in recent years. Notably, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed as a means of learning representations which utilize graph topology and node features, and are optimized toward targeted tasks of interest.  Several such tasks deal with the challenging problem of learning with scarce, or nonexistent labeled data, common in domains like online trust and integrity.  In this talk, I'll overview two recent works on learning in label-free and label-scarce settings on graph data with GNNs.  The first work, published at TNNLS'21, discusses the use of integrating traditional unsupervised and modern GNN-based approaches for graph anomaly detection in a unified framework, demonstrating marked improvements in learned representation quality for anomaly detection tasks over both traditional and modern independent baselines. The second work, published at AAAI'21, discusses an approach for data augmentation for GNNs which shows large improvements in semi-supervised node classification, particularly in label-scarce settings.  Together, the two works paint a promising picture for practical use of graph ML methods in settings with limited labels, by incorporating useful priors and stretching available labeled data with augmentation strategies. I'll also very briefly mention a few other exciting works our group has been up to, grounded in practically minded GNN research. </p>

                  <p>We consider the problem of learning efficient and inductive graph convolutional networks for text classification with a large number of examples and features. Existing state-of-the-art graph embedding based methods such as predictive text embedding (PTE) and TextGCN have shortcomings in terms of predictive performance, scalability and inductive capability. To address these limitations, we propose a heterogeneous graph convolutional network (HeteGCN) modeling approach that unites the best aspects of PTE and TextGCN together. The main idea is to learn feature embeddings and derive document embeddings using a HeteGCN architecture with different graphs used across layers. We simplify TextGCN by dissecting into several HeteGCN models which (a) helps to study the usefulness of individual models and (b) offers flexibility in fusing learned embeddings from different models. In effect, the number of model parameters is reduced significantly, enabling faster training and improving performance in small labeled training set scenario. Our detailed experimental studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

During my PhD, I worked on building machine learning models for predicting aggregate label statistics. Currently, post my PhD, I have joined Microsoft Research, exploring two areas - 1] Learning Representations on Graphs and 2] Intersection of Program Synthesis and Machine Learning.</p>

                  <p>We investigate the capability of a transformer pretrained on natural language to generalize to other modalities with minimal finetuning -- in particular, without finetuning of the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual blocks. We consider such a model, which we call a Frozen Pretrained Transformer (FPT), and study finetuning it on a variety of sequence classification tasks spanning numerical computation, vision, and protein fold prediction. In contrast to prior works which investigate finetuning on the same modality as the pretraining dataset, we show that pretraining on natural language can improve performance and compute efficiency on non-language downstream tasks. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the architecture, comparing the performance of a random initialized transformer to a random LSTM. Combining the two insights, we find language-pretrained transformers can obtain strong performance on a variety of non-language tasks.</p>

                  <p>In this talk I will present a set of experiments designed to help us understand what neural named entity recognition systems learn and why they make the predictions we see. Specifically, we seek to understand if systems learn name strings (Ani, Julia, Kathy) or if they are able to identify textual contexts that constrain the semantics class of whatever word appears in that context ("My name is __ "). I will present evidence that the performance of neural methods is largely driven by their ability to recognize word tokens as belonging to certain semantic classes. In a study with people, we find that in many cases people are indeed able to identify constraining contexts and figure out the class only from the context in the sentence. People's recognition of constraining contexts aligns better with predictions from biLSTM-CRF models than BERT models. I will present compelling evidence that current models do not integrate contextual clues effectively. These results indicate that NER is a challenging yet practical domain for testing machine text comprehension abilities.

                     While we have made great progress in natural language
                     understanding, transferring the success from benchmark datasets to real
                     applications has not always been smooth. Notably, models sometimes make
                     mistakes that are confusing and unexpected to humans. In this talk, I will
                     discuss shortcuts in NLP tasks and present our recent works on guarding
                     against spurious correlations in natural language understanding tasks (e.g.
                     textual entailment and paraphrase identification) from the perspectives of
                     both robust learning algorithms and better data coverage. Motivated by the
                     observation that our data often contains a small amount of "unbiased"
                     examples that do not exhibit spurious correlations, we present new learning
                     algorithms that better exploit these minority examples. On the other hand,
                     we may want to directly augment such "unbiased" examples. While recent
                     works along this line are promising, we show several pitfalls in the data
                     augmentation approach.

                    <p>Current NLP pipelines rely significantly on finetuning large pre-trained language models. Relying on this paradigm makes such pipelines challenging to use in real-world settings since massive task-specific models are neither memory- nor inference-efficient, nor do we understand how they fare in adversarial settings. This talk will describe our attempts to address these seemingly unrelated concerns by investigating how specific short phrases in the input can control model behavior. These short phrases (which we call triggers) will help us identify model vulnerabilities and introduce new paradigms of training models.

                    In the first part of the talk, I will focus on the adversarial setting. I will show how easy it is for adversaries to craft triggers that cause a target model to misbehave when the trigger appears in the input. I will also introduce a data poisoning technique that enables adversaries to inject arbitrary triggers into the target model. However, in the second part of the talk, I will show how these triggers can also be used to “prompt” language models to act as task-specific models, providing a negligible-memory, no-learning way to create classifiers. I will end with a comprehensive study of the interplay between prompting and finetuning, providing some guidelines for effectively performing few-shot learning with large language models.</p>
